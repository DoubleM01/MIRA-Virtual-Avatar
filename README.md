# MIRA Virtual Avatar

A comprehensive project for generating realistic text-to-speech (TTS), emotion-based avatars, and synchronized video outputs. This project integrates multiple services to create a seamless pipeline for generating expressive avatars with synchronized audio and video.

---

## Features

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Generate realistic speech from text using advanced TTS models.
- **Emotion-Based Avatars:** Create avatars that reflect specific emotions based on input parameters.
- **Video Generation:** Produce synchronized video outputs with audio and avatar animations.
- **Customizable Pipelines:** Modular design for integrating additional features or models.

## Usage

1. Start the GUI local version:
   ```python
   python main.py
   ```

2. Start gradio version:
   ```python
   python app.py
   ```

3. Use the gradio server for avatar generation "local host" at `http://127.0.0.1:7860`.

4. Preview available for both of GUI and gradio.
5. Generated outputs will be saved as a file  `output/results.mp4`.
